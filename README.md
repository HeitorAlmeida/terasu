# Terasu

Author: Heitor Almeida, 2018-2019

# Overview

Terasu is a metroidvania in which you fly, breaking one of the main conventions of the genre, the platforming. You can move in every 2D direction and you better do it fast, cause darkness is always trying to extinguish your inner light. Terasu drinks from the spring of the shinto myth and creates a timeless adventure with charismatic pixel-art characters.

# Development

Developed with Unity (C#) and GIMP. I've developed it, solo, for about an year and a half, but I couldn't continue and the project is on hold indefinitely. It already features a solid hour of gameplay, full of challenges and exploration.

# Files

In this repository I've made available the entire Assets folder for the Unity project. By replacing the folder with the same name on a new project and resolving some minor platform version issues that will most likely arise, one should be able to get the project running in no time.
