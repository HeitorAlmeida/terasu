To make some cool lighting effects, I've implemented fake lights and normal maps for sprites.

The fake lights are lights that interact only with the shader I've made. They are normal objects
with no global visibility. They are not autommatically fed to all shaders like unity lights are.
If an object wants to be lit by a fake light, it needs to feed the light information to its own shader.

The fake lights interact with the shader respecting the sprite's normal map. The faces of the object
that face the light are more lit than the faces that do not. So, the more a face of the object faces the
light, the stronger it will be lit.

To create the normal map for a sprite, I open the texture in GIMP, choose the layer, change its mode
to greyscale. Once it's black and white, go to filters->mapping->normalMap. It gives a scale option that
I got good results with value 6. The reverse Y option must be checked cause the shader will interpret
the y coordinates normally only if they are reversed.
