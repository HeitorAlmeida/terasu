Having already installed the Android SDK, you can access the following folder:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Android\android-sdk\platform-tools

There you will find a program called ADB.

If you go to the folder with a command prompt or bring a copy of the CMD program to the folder,
you will be able to use ADB.

Use "adb devices" to see if the device is being recognized by adb.

Use "adb logcat" to see all the log messages of programs running in the device.

Use "adb logcat -s Unity" to see only the log messages of the program Unity running in the device.

Use "adb logact -s Unity > debug.txt" to print the log messages of the program into a txt file.
