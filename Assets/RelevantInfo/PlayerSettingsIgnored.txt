If the player settings of resolution and etc are being ignored in the generation of builds, it is because
Unity is picking up values that were stored in the Windows registry from a previous build. In that case you
need to wipe these playerprefs. Use a script like this to add the option of wiping playerprefs to Unity Editor.

using UnityEditor;
using UnityEngine;
 
public class AddMenu : EditorWindow
{
     [MenuItem("Edit/Reset Playerprefs")]
 
     public static void DeletePlayerPrefs()
     {
         PlayerPrefs.DeleteAll();
     }
 
}

This script should be stored in a folder called Editor, inside the project.
