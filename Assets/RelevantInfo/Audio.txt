Audio playback in Android has a really long delay when dealing with Unity's AudioSource and AudioClips.
Like half a second long, unacceptably long. It may even be unnoticed when dealing with musics, but when
we play sound effects that must be as synchronized as possible with the visuals, it fails miserably. 

Some kind people developed a plugin that bypasses a lot of the sound preparation that Unity does in
Android, and this plugin does not use the AudioSource or AudioClips. It loads at runtime the wav sounds
and plays them much faster. The audio files have to be in a specific folder, within Assets, called
StreamingAssets. However, when you put any audio files within this StreamingAssets folder, they lose
their AudioClip status and can no longer be used as such. For that reason, they can't be assigned to
public AudioClip fields in objects. Furthermore, they have to be loaded from a string with their path.

The conclusion is that we either need to have duplicates of all sound effects, one version as AudioClip
outside of StreamingAssets and one version as wav within StreamingAssets or we need a way of obtaining
the AudioClip from a wav file. The plugin already supports the duplicates option.

If we choose to have duplicates, it is needed to set the paths outside of StreamingAssets and inside it
as duplicates so we can use the same path string to load the AudioClip version and the wav version.
Like this: "Assets/StreamingAssets/Resources/Sounds/jump.wav" and "Assets/Resources/Sounds/jump".
When the plugin loads a wav sound in Android, the path it creates starts with "Resources/Sounds/", so
that path has to be valid from the StreamingAssets folder. When the plugin loads an AudioClip to use
outside of Android, it uses the "Sounds/" path from the Resources folder.
